How the project Work

After landing on the web page the user will see a form where they will fill their credentials or if they have an account they will be allowed to login directly, the users will not be allowed to move the login page if they have not added all their credentials to the register form.
When the user has successfully logged in they will be directed to the login form where they will fill all their credentials and after a successful login they will be directed to a page that has a table with some information.
